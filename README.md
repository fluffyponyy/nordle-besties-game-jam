<h3 class="text-center">Notes</h3>
<p>After having the idea for a Wordle that changes the word with each guess, I found Absurdle online. I decided to implement my own algorithm for an "evil Wordle" that differs from Absurdle in two ways:</p>
<ul><li>Chooses next grouping of words based on lowest number of greens/yellows</li><li>Sometimes nondeterministic (whenever two or more groups of words tie for&nbsp;the lowest number of greens/yellow, one group is selected randomly)</li></ul>
<p>I also chose to keep it limited to 6 tries like classic Wordle, since it is not quite as difficult as Absurdle.</p>
